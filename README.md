# Hot Take Bot

### Bot used to store friends sports takes for later review
- This bot reads through a specified number of messages in my specified GroupMe chat
- If a message contains the phrase 'hot take' (capitalization not taken into consideration), it will the store the message and user (if they have not been stored already), and it will respond to the user with one of a few pre-written phrases

### Purpose
- This was originally written to store the sports opinions and predictions of friends, so the data could be queried and evaluated later
